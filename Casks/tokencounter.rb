# Homebrew cask for TokenCounter.
#
# This file belongs in a repository named `homebrew-tap` (or `homebrew-<name>`)
# under `Casks/`, not here — it lives in this repo only as the source of truth to
# copy from. Users then install with:
#
#   brew install --cask wdremington/tap/tokencounter
#
# The official homebrew/cask tap enforces a notability floor (roughly 30 forks /
# 30 watchers / 75 stars, checked in CI), so a new project is not eligible there
# yet. An own tap has no such bar and behaves identically for the user.
#
# Before each release: bump `version`, and paste the sha256 that
# `./build.sh --release` prints.
